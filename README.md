# N1-Slack

A Slack-inspired theme for Nylas N1

### Disclaimer

As this theme uses Slack's design language, if they want me to take it down, I will.

### Dev notes

Have been unable to style the following areas because 1) they dissapear on mouse blur, 2) the HTML is removed on mouse blur, or 3) they appear and dissapear too quick to capture class names

* Search results dropdown
* Add new Tag in accounts sidebar
* Activity indicator in sidebar (syncing inbox, applying label, etc)
