# N1-Slack

A Slack-inspired theme for Nylas N1

### Disclaimer

As this theme uses Slack's design language, if they want me to take it down, I will.

### Dev notes

* Slack has far larger icons. Any chance of getting a copy of the icon SVGs so I can embed them at a larger size? Specifically in the top toolbar.
* Lato is currently loaded from Google Fonts every time, which means no offline support. Can we package Lato with the theme?
* Need to style the drag-email cursor
* Need to style the drag-over state of sidebar accounts/tags
* Need to style the sidebar status indicator (bottom of sidebar)
